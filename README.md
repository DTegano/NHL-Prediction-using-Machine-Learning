# NHL Prediction using Machine Learning

<b> Project Background: </b> Using the 2017-2018 and 2018-2019 NHL Seasons as my training data, I will predict the 2019-2020 NHL Ganes using a Machine Learning Model. My variables will include: Date of the game, Home Team, Away Team, Result (training only - reflects Home Team), Home Goals, Home Shots, Home PIM (Penalties in Minutes), Away Goals, Away PIM, Away Shots, Home Corsi (all situations), Away Corsi, Home Offensive Zone Start %, Away Offensive Zone Start %, Home Hits, Away Hits, Home Blocked Shots, Away Blocked Shots, Game Length (Regulation, Overtime, or Shootout), Empty_Netters (reflects empty net goals for the winning team), Home Save %, Away Save %, Home Shooting %, Away Shooting %, Home SPSV%/PDO, Away SPSV%/PDO, Home Goals Against, Away Goals Against, Home Differential, Away Differential, Home Wins, Away Wins, Home Shots Against, Away Shots Against, Home Points and Away Points. Prediction results will depend on whether it was the home or away team that won the game.

This is part 2 of my main overall project. In order to predict games, the NHL data needs to be structured in a specific way. If you're unfamiliar with this process or haven't read Part 1 of this project, please check out this link: https://github.com/DTegano/Web-Scraping-NHL-Data-for-Prediction-using-Machine-Learning

# Libraries 

Here are my libraries:

``
library(readxl) # importing xls & xlsx files
library(dplyr) # used for nesting/chaining
library(tidyr) # data cleaning
library(stringr) # Used to detect OT and Shootouts
library(writexl) # exporting to xlsx file
library(chron) # Date conversion to Time
library(stats) # Group Functional
library(plyr) # ddpylr for aggregation
``

# Importing the Data

First, I'll import both my training and test set. For the sake of analysis, I'll combine both sets into one data frame:

``
dtrain = read_excel("Training Final.xlsx", col_names = TRUE)
dtest = read_excel("Test Final.xlsx", col_names = TRUE)

dt = rbind(dtrain, dtest)
``

Once I have combined my training set with my entire test set, I'll remove the Results column from my test set - as this will be the variable we will be predicting:

``
dtest = dtest[,-4]
``

# Pre-analysis tune up

Before conducting analysis, it's always a good idea to view the data and get familiar with its' contents before. Since I'm using R, it's also a good idea to attach your data set so that variables are much easier to call. Once this has been completed, one of the first commands you should run with a new data frame is the structure and summary functions. Since my teams and results loaded in as characters, I'll first change these variables to factors. Once the change has been made,
