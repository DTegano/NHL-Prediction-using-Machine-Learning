# NHL Prediction using Machine Learning

<b> Project Background: </b> Using the 2017-2018 and 2018-2019 NHL Seasons as my training data, I will predict the 2019-2020 NHL Ganes using a Machine Learning Model. My variables will include: Date of the game, Home Team, Away Team, Result (training only - reflects Home Team), Home Goals, Home Shots, Home PIM (Penalties in Minutes), Away Goals, Away PIM, Away Shots, Home Corsi (all situations), Away Corsi, Home Offensive Zone Start %, Away Offensive Zone Start %, Home Hits, Away Hits, Home Blocked Shots, Away Blocked Shots, Game Length (Regulation, Overtime, or Shootout), Empty_Netters (reflects empty net goals for the winning team), Home Save %, Away Save %, Home Shooting %, Away Shooting %, Home SPSV%/PDO, Away SPSV%/PDO, Home Goals Against, Away Goals Against, Home Differential, Away Differential, Home Wins, Away Wins, Home Shots Against, Away Shots Against, Home Points and Away Points. Prediction results will depend on whether it was the home or away team that won the game.

This is part 2 of my main overall project. In order to predict games, the NHL data needs to be structured in a specific way.
